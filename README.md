# AnalyzeAnalyzing-International-Debt-Statistics

#Introduction:

This project aims to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt owed by developing countries across various categories. The primary objective is to gain insights into the total debt amount, identify the country with the maximum debt, and calculate the average debt owed by countries across different debt indicators.
Dataset:

The dataset used for this analysis includes information about international debt for different countries. It consists of columns such as country name, debt indicator, debt type, and the amount of debt owed (in USD).
Analysis:

    Total Debt Amount:
    The first step of the analysis involves calculating the total amount of debt owed by all countries listed in the dataset. This is achieved by running a SQL query that calculates the sum of debt amounts across all rows in the dataset.

    Country with Maximum Debt:
    The second step is to identify the country that owns the maximum amount of debt and determine the exact amount. This is accomplished through another SQL query that selects the country with the highest debt value.

    Average Debt by Debt Indicators:
    The final step is to compute the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators. This involves grouping the data by debt indicator and calculating the average debt for each category using SQL.

Conclusion:

By analyzing the international debt data, we have obtained valuable insights into the total amount of debt owed by countries, identified the country with the highest debt, and calculated the average debt across different debt indicators. This information can be useful for understanding the debt patterns and financial situations of various developing countries.
